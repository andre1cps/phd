# Description

## Overview

In this repository you can find all of the studies related to my atmospheric physics doctoral thesis where I have been using granger causality and machine learning approaches for evaluating climate-vegetation interactions in South America.

## cdlearn

As part of this PhD project, I am developing a python package named `cdlearn` for analysing climate data in the framework of causality and machine learning. Please feel free to see [cdlearn's documentation](https://cdlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and note that suggestions and corrections are always welcome.
