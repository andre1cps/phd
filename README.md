# Description

## Overview

In this repository you can find all of the studies related to my atmospheric physics doctoral thesis where I have been using granger causality and machine learning approaches for evaluating climate-vegetation interactions in South America.

## cdlearn

As part of this PhD project, I am developing a python package named `cdlearn` for analysing climate data in the framework of causality and machine learning. Please feel free to see [cdlearn's documentation](https://cdlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?), and note that suggestions and corrections are always welcome.

## Data analysis environment

The main data science framework used here is based on python language as installed from conda distribution on Ubuntu 18.04 commom machines. You can see my full current conda environment [here](https://github.com/SandroAlex/python_environment).
