 - [ndvi_statistics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SandroAlex/phd/blob/master/notebooks/make_figures/ndvi_statistics.ipynb?flush_cache=true): Original data spatial resolution as well as regridded data in order to fit ERA-INTERIM grid. Monthly means maps. Standard deviation. Seasonal means maps. Empirical orthogonal functions analysis for regridded data.

 - [ndvi_statistics2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SandroAlex/phd/blob/master/notebooks/make_figures/ndvi_statistics2.ipynb?flush_cache=true): Only reggrided data. Find temporal and spatial occurrences of extreme values.
