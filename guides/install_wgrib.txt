----------------------------------------------------------
For Linux and OS X when you do NOT have superuser access:
create a  ~/local subdirectory under your home directory 

> mkdir ~/local
This is a good place to put special utilities/packages only used by you.

Then make a subdirectory for each package, e.g.
> mkdir ~/local/wgrib

Put the tar file there:
> mv wgrib.tar ~/local/wgrib

> cd ~/local/wgrib
> tar xvf wgrib.tar

wgrib is written in C, so make sure you have a C compiler
> which cc
You should get something similar to this:
/usr/bin/cc

cc is included in Linux systems.
For OS X, you may need to install Xcode to obtain cc.

Then let the makefile do all the work for you--no C experience necessary. 
> make

If you are successful, wgrib*, an executable, will be created:
~/local/wgrib/wgrib*

I like to put all my local executables in one place in my search path.
> mkdir ~/local/bin
> ln -s ~/local/wgrib/wgrib ~/local/bin

Put this line in your .tcshrc file (or equivalent in other shells):
set path = ($path $HOME/bin $HOME/local/bin .)

----------------------------------------------------------
For OS X Mavericks or Linux with SuperUser privileges:

su to login as an administrator on your machine
> su

Login and then create a directory to hold wgrib.
> sudo mkdir /usr/local/wgrib
> sudo cp wgrib.tar 
	FROM your Download area 
	TO /usr/local/wgrib
> sudo tar xvf wgrib.tar
> sudo make

If you are successful, wgrib*, an executable, will be created:
/usr/local/wgrib/wgrib*

Create a soft link to a directory with other local executables, e.g.
> sudo ln -s /usr/local/wgrib/wgrib /usr/local/bin

Now any user with /usr/local/bin in their path can use wgrib.

----------------------------------------------------------
Test in your work directory.

> which wgrib
should return the location of wgrib

> wgrib grib_file
should return an inventory of grib_file
